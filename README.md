[User Management](##)

[Public Registration (Hotel and Government Users)](###)

The POST /users/register endpoint allows hotel and government users to register themselves directly.

1. How It Works

   - Users must provide a username, password, and role during registration.
   - Accepted roles for public registration:
        hotel
        government
   - If the role is invalid or the username already exists, the registration will fail with an appropriate error message.

2. Endpoint Details

    URL: POST /users/register

    Request Body:

        ``` jason

        {
        "username": "hotel_1",
        "password": "password1234",
        "role": "hotel"
        }

         ```

    Responses:

        Success:

            {
            "message": "User registered successfully."
            }

        Error (Invalid Role):

            {
            "error": "Invalid role. Only \"hotel\" and \"government\" roles can register."
            }

        Error (Duplicate Username):

            {
            "error": "Username already exists."
            }

3.  Database Updates

    A new entry is added to the users table with the provided username, a hashed password, and the specified role.

[Admin User Management](###)

Admin users cannot register themselves through the public registration endpoint. They are added and managed exclusively through the back-end.

1. How Admin Users Are Managed

    Admin users are added using a Knex seed file.
    A pre-defined seed file (seeds/add_admin_user.js) inserts admin users into the users table.

2. Adding a New Admin User

    To add a new admin user:

        Open the seeds/add_admin_user.js file.
        Update the username and password fields as needed.
        Run the seed file:

        npx knex --knexfile ./config/knexfile.js seed:run --specific=add_admin_user.js

2. Verifying Admin Users

    After running the seed file, confirm the admin user exists in the database:

        Open MySQL Workbench or your database management tool.
        Run the following query:

        SELECT * FROM users WHERE role = 'admin';

3. Security Notes

    Only trusted developers or staff should have access to the seed file.
    Ensure the admin user passwords are hashed securely.

[Admin: Add Tourism Statistics](##)

This feature allows admin users to add new tourism statistics to the database. The `POST /admin/statistics` endpoint ensures that only authorized admin users can perform this operation.

[API Endpoint](###)
- URL: `POST /admin/statistics`
- Authorization: Requires a valid JWT token for an admin user in the `Authorization` header.
- Role Restriction: Only accessible to users with the role `admin`.

[Request](###)

[Headers](####)

```json

{
  "Authorization": "Bearer <your_admin_token>"
}

```

[Body](####)

```json

{
  "region_name": "Noosa",
  "date": "2024-01-01",
  "average_historical_occupancy": 75.5,
  "average_daily_rate": 120.0,
  "average_length_of_stay": 3.2,
  "average_booking_window": 14.0
}
```

[Response](####)

| Status Code | Description                                   |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `201`       | Success: Tourism statistics added successfully. |
| `401`       | Unauthorized: Missing or invalid JWT token.   |
| `403`       | Forbidden: User is not an admin.              |
| `400`       | Bad Request: Invalid or missing input fields. |
| `500`       | Internal Server Error: Database or server issue. |

[Verify in SQL database](###)

Run the following query in MySQL workbench:

```sql

SELECT 
    s.id AS statistics_id,
    r.region_name,
    s.date,
    s.average_historical_occupancy,
    s.average_daily_rate,
    s.average_length_of_stay,
    s.average_booking_window
FROM 
    statistics s
JOIN 
    regions r
ON 
    s.region_id = r.id
ORDER BY 
    s.id DESC
LIMIT 1;

```

[Workflow](###)

1.  Validation: Ensure the JWT token is valid and the user has the admin role
2.  Region check: If region_name doesnâ€™t exist in the regions table, it will be added automatically
3.  Statistics Insertion: Insert the provided statistics into the statistics table with a reference to the region_id from the regions table

[Security](###)
-   Only admin users are authorized to access this endpoint. Authorization is enforced using a JWT-based middleware.
-   Tokens are validated for expiry and role (must be admin)

[Front-End Integration Suggestions](###)

1.  Role-Specific UI: Ensure that only admin users see options to add tourism statistics
2.  Token Management: Use the admin user's JWT token for authentication
3.  Form design: Add a form with fields matching the API request body
    -   Dropdown or autocomplete for region_name (to suggest existing regions).
    -   Input fields for date, average_historical_occupancy,average_daily_rate, average_length_of_stay, and average_booking_window.
4.  Error Handling: Display appropriate messages based on the response (e.g., unauthorized, validation errors)
